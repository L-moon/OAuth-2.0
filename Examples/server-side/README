Note : There are many different ways to use OAuth .

In this example , we retrieve all contacts from google for a user.
There are two files :
1. google-contacts.rkt : for getting all contacts
2. oauth2callback.rkt  : authorization server redirects here,and we redirect
   back to some continuation in google-contacts.rkt

Main function is get-authorization in google-contacts.rkt.
You will need to provide oauth object in google-conatcts.rkt
for the example to work.


We use state parameter to pass the continuation url to authorization server, 
and when google redirect to our redirect-uri , we again redirect to 
continuation uri from where we continue.
