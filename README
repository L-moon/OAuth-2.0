A Simple implementation of OAuth-2.0 protocol in Racket.
This does not fully implement the actual protocol.

Status : Only tested with google oauth flow.

See Example dir for different types of flow and use.


There are three basic api for OAuth :

1. request-owner-for-grant : 
   Asks the owner for grant to use its resource by redirecting it to
   Authorization/Server URI

2. get-grant-resp : checks if owner has granted us the authorization code 

3. request-access-token : Once the owner has given the grant , request is
   made to token server for access-token

There is one basic object called  oauth object , which is created
by function make-oauth-2 , which takes client-id , client-secret ,
authorization-uri , token-uri , redirect-uri and response-type .

The request-owner-for-grant and request-access-toke both requires oauth object.
