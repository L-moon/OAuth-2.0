Note : There are many different ways to use OAuth .

1. google-contacts.rkt : for getting all contacts

2. facebook-graph.rkt : similar to 1 , but related to social info 
   I don't know much about facebook , hopefully the api is correct.
   
3. authorization-handler.rkt : handles everything related to
   authorization. It is used by google-conatcts.rkt and facebook-graph.rkt
   To start abstracting start from this file.

4. oauth2callback.rkt  : authorization server redirects here,and we redirect
   back to some local url.
