A Simple implementation of OAuth-2.0 client protocol in Racket.

Current it is usable , but api's not fixed and no documentation.
Lib will became stable when I upload it to planet , which I hope
to do in a week or two.
         
See Example dir for different types of flow and use.
Also see  http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html
