A Simple implementation of OAuth-2.0 client protocol in Racket.

This does not fully implement the actual protocol.

Status : This is early stage of project.
         Partially tested with google oauth flow.
	 Partially tested with facebook oauth flow.


See Example dir for different types of flow and use.

Step by Step explanation coming soon, till then see http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html


There are three basic api for OAuth :

1. request-owner-for-grant : 
   Asks the owner/user for grant to use its resource by redirecting it to
   Authorization/Server URI

2. get-grant-resp : checks if owner/user has granted us the authorization code 

3. request-access-token : Once the owner/user has given the grant , request is
   made to token server for access-token

There is one basic object called  oauth object , which is created
by function make-oauth-2 , which takes client-id , client-secret ,
authorization-uri , token-uri , redirect-uri and response-type .

The request-owner-for-grant and request-access-toke both requires oauth object.
